## Course Overview

Based on the course memorandum, students will learn:

- Python syntax, semantics, and standard library.
- Object-oriented programming.
- Git workflows for version control.
- AI concepts, use cases, and ethics.
- Data handling, visualization, and interpretation.
- Machine learning and deep learning foundations.
- AI-assisted development workflows.

## Technologies and Tools

- Python.
- Visual Studio Code.
- PyCharm.
- Git.
- Jupyter.
- Pandas.
- Scikit-learn.
- TensorFlow and Keras.

## Weekly Structure

Each week has an ordered folder name to keep navigation predictable:

- `week-01-*` ... `week-08-*`.

Inside a week, microlessons are grouped into ordered section folders:

- `01-*`, `02-*`, `03-*`, and so on.

Inside each section, file naming is consistent and explicit:

- `01-theory.md` for concepts.
- `02-worked-examples.md` for step-by-step examples.
- `03-practice.md` for required exercises.
- `04-challenge.md` for optional challenge exercises.
- `05-reflection.md` for recall and short reflection.
