# What is Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence?

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Artificial Intelligence, commonly referred to as AI, is a broad field of computer science that aims to create machines
that can perform tasks that, when done by humans, require intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving,
understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions.

AI can be classified into two main types:

- **Narrow or Weak AI**: This is the most common form of AI. It is designed and trained for a particular task. Virtual
  personal assistants like Siri or Alexa are examples of Narrow AI.
- **General or Strong AI**: This form of AI is still largely theoretical and represents a system that has all the
  cognitive abilities of a human. Such a system can autonomously perform any intellectual task that a human can do.

## Machine Learning (ML)

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that allow
computers to perform a task without using explicit instructions. Instead, they rely on patterns and inference. In
simpler terms, ML enables computers to learn from data.

There are three primary types of machine learning:

- **Supervised Learning**: The algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning the algorithm is provided with
  input-output pairs. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: The algorithm is provided with no labels for the training data and must find structure in
  the input data on its own. Common tasks include clustering and dimensionality reduction.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form
  of rewards or penalties.

## Relationship between AI and ML

Machine Learning is a crucial component of the modern AI landscape. While AI encompasses a broader realm of cognitive
abilities, ML provides the methods and algorithms that allow computers to perform specific tasks without being
explicitly programmed. Essentially, all machine learning is AI, but not all AI is machine learning.

## Applications and Use Cases

Both AI and ML have seen a vast array of applications in the modern world. They power recommendation systems on
platforms like Netflix and Spotify, assist in medical diagnoses, enable autonomous vehicles, and even play a role in
financial forecasting. The potential and scope of AI and ML are vast, and we're only scratching the surface of their
capabilities.
