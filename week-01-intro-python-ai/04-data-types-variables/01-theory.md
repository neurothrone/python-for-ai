# 01. Theory: Data Types and Variables

## Why This Matters

Data types and variables are the building blocks of all Python code. When students understand what kind of data they are
storing and how to convert between types, they make fewer bugs and write clearer solutions to real problems.

## Variables

Variables are labeled boxes that store values with meaningful names.

```python
student_name = "Maya"
student_age = 21
```

## Core Data Types

| Type    | Example   | Meaning        |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| `str`   | `"hello"` | Text           |
| `int`   | `7`       | Whole number   |
| `float` | `3.14`    | Decimal number |
| `bool`  | `True`    | True/False     |

## Type Conversion

```python
age = int("20")
price = float("19.99")
count_as_text = str(5)
```

## Simple Operations

```python
a = 10
b = 3
print(a + b)
print(a - b)
print(a * b)
print(a / b)
```
