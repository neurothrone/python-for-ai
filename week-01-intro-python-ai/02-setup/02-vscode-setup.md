### Install VS Code

### Add Python Extension

In VS Code, install the `Python` extension by Microsoft.

### Create a Practice Folder

Create a folder for your practice files either by opening a folder in VS Code or in the terminal:

```bash
# This creates a folder called week1-practice
mkdir week1-practice 
# This opens the folder in VS Code
code week1-practice
```

## Run First File

Create `main.py`:

```python
print("VS Code is operational!")
```

Run from the terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

Or use the VS Code Run button.

## Quick Troubleshooting

- Command not found: confirm Python installation and PATH.
- Wrong interpreter: use `Python: Select Interpreter` command.
- No Run button: ensure Python extension is installed.
