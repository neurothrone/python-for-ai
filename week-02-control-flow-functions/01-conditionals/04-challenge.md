# 04. Challenge: Conditionals

## Challenge Tasks

1. Build a small grade checker for scores from `0` to `100`.
2. Ask for three numbers and print the largest.
3. Ask for a year and print whether it is a leap year (basic rule only: divisible by 4).

## Hint

Write one condition at a time. Test your code after each step.
