# 05. Reflection: Conditionals

## Recall Questions

1. What is the difference between `if` and `elif`?
2. Why do we use `==` in conditions?
3. Why is input conversion important for numeric checks?

## Micro Reflection

Write 3–4 lines:

- One conditional bug I made this week.
- Why it happened (type issue, wrong operator, or indentation).
- How I fixed it.
- One rule I will use next time.

## Applied Practice (Optional)

Write one real-life rule as an `if/elif/else` flow. Example idea: transport choice based on weather.
