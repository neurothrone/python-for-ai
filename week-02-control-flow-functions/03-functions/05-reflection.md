# 05. Reflection: Functions

## Recall Questions

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
2. Why is `return` important?
3. What is local scope?

## Micro Reflection

Write 3–4 lines:

- One function bug I made this week.
- Why it happened (`print` vs `return`, wrong argument, or scope issue).
- How I fixed it.
- One function rule I will use in future tasks.

## Applied Practice (Optional)

Take one solution from this week and split it into two smaller functions. Write one sentence about why the new version
is clearer.
