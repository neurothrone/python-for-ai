# 05. Reflection: Loops

## Recall Questions

1. When is `for` better than `while`?
2. Why do some `while` loops become infinite?
3. What does correct indentation do in loops?

## Micro Reflection

Write 3–4 lines:

- One loop bug I made this week.
- Why it happened (indentation, condition, or counter update).
- How I fixed it.
- One loop safety check I will always do.

## Applied Practice (Optional)

Write one example from daily life where a `while` loop fits better than a `for` loop.
